AstaroGuard — Terms of Service

Last Updated: 8/24/25

0. Preamble; Contract Formation; Electronic Consent

0.1 Contracting Entity. These Terms of Service (the “Terms,” “Agreement”) are a binding contract between you (“you,” “your,” or the “User”) and the developer/operator of the AstaroGuard Discord bot (“AstaroGuard,” “we,” “us,” “our,” or the “Operator”). If you accept on behalf of an organization, you represent you have authority to bind that entity; “you” then means that entity.

0.2 Acceptance. By inviting, installing, enabling, configuring, using, or otherwise interacting with the AstaroGuard Discord bot and related services (collectively, the “Services”), you agree to these Terms and to (i) our Privacy Policy; (ii) our Data Processing Addendum (“DPA”) where applicable; (iii) any feature-specific terms; and (iv) any jurisdiction-specific supplements (together, the “AstaroGuard Terms”). If you do not agree, do not use the Services.

0.3 Electronic Signatures and Notices. You consent to transact electronically and to receive notices electronically under the U.S. E-SIGN Act (15 U.S.C. § 7001 et seq.) and applicable UETA enactments. Notices may be delivered via Discord, email, dashboard, or publication.

0.4 Hierarchy. If there is a conflict among documents: Jurisdictional Supplement (if applicable) → Feature Terms → DPA → Privacy Policy → these Terms.

If JAMS is unavailable, the parties will select a comparable forum. Venue for any in-person hearing will be [County/State] or your county of residence, at your election; otherwise, hearings may occur by video.

20.3 Class/Representative Waiver. YOU AND ASTAROGUARD AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.

If 25 or more substantially similar claims are filed by the same or coordinated counsel, the parties shall (a) group claims into randomized batches of up to 25; (b) arbitrate a batch; (c) mediate remaining claims; and (d) repeat as needed. Fees will be staged to promote efficiency. Arbitrators may not award fees/penalties for batching unless authorized by law.

20.8 Small Claims; IP. Either party may bring qualifying claims in small claims court after MIDR. Claims seeking to enforce IP rights (copyright, patent, trademark, trade secret) may proceed in court.

20.9 Opt-Out. You may opt out of this arbitration agreement within 30 days of first use by sending an email to arbitration-optout@[your-domain] with your name, Discord tag, server ID, and a clear statement of opt-out; or by mailing a signed letter to our Legal Address. Opt-out does not affect other terms.

Unless prohibited by law, any claim must be filed within one (1) year after the cause of action accrues, or be forever barred.

22. Government End Users

The Services are “commercial computer software” under 48 C.F.R. § 2.101 and 12.212. Use by U.S. Government end users is subject to the restrictions in these Terms.

23. Modification of Terms

We may revise these Terms. If changes are material, we will provide notice as required by law. Changes become effective upon posting or stated effective date. Continued use constitutes acceptance. If you do not agree, discontinue use and remove the bot.
